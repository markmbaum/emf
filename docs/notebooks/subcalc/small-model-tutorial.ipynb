    "Fundamentally, using `emf.subcalc` requires creating `Tower` and/or `Conductor` objects, putting them into a `Model` object, and running the `Model` object's `calculate` method to generate a `Results` object.\n",

    "First step: creating `Tower`/`Conductor` objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we'll only use `Tower` objects because `Conductor` objects are usually not necessary. A `Conductor` object represents a single current carrying wire in a model domain, with the coordinates of the wire's path specified explicitly. A `Tower` object, on the other hand, represents a single tower/pole/frame with power lines strung up on it, with the positions of the wires specified in the tower's frame of reference instead of in explicit x,y,z coordinates. To create a `Tower`, we have to the following information:\n",
    "* Group string. The \"group\" string is used to define which towers have power lines running between them.\n",
    "* Sequence integer. The \"seq\" number defines the order in which power lines are strung between towers in the same group. \n",
    "* x and y coordinates in our model domain\n",
    "* Rotation angle. The rotation angle is zero along the +x axis and increases toward the +y axis. This is different from the old SUBCALC program, which defines 0 rotation along the -y axis.\n",
    "* Horizontal coordinates of wires on the tower, in the tower's reference frame. These are simply the horizontal distances of each wire from the tower.\n",
    "* Vertical coordinates of wires on the tower, which are identical to z coordinates in the model domain. They're simply the distance above ground (where the ground surface is at z=0).\n",
    "* The current amplitude of each wire\n",
    "* The phase angle of each wire\n",
    "\n",
    "Tower objects, and `emf.subcalc` in general, expect units of feet, Amps, and degrees.\n",
